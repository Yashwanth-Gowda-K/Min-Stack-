# Min-Stack-


🏗️ Min Stack - O(1) Operations
A stack implementation that supports push, pop, top, and getMin—all in constant time.

🎯 Problem Statement
Design a stack where retrieving the minimum element is as fast as accessing the top.

🧠 Key Insight
Instead of storing just values, each entry keeps track of:
The pushed value
The minimum up to that point
This ensures getMin() always returns in O(1) without extra computations.

🚀 Applications
Efficient minimum tracking in algorithms
Common coding interview question (FAANG/top tech)
Demonstrates optimal auxiliary space usage
No brute-force scans—just smart design! 🔥
